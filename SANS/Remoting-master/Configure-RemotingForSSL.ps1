#.Synopsis 
#    Configures the SSL/TLS settings for PowerShell remoting.
#
#.Description
#    The script will walk the user through the steps necessary to choose a
#    machine certificate and configure WSMan settings necessary to support 
#    PowerShell remoting over an SSL/TLS encrypted channel.  The script does
#    not 1) enable PowerShell remoting or 2) create a Windows Firewall rule to
#    allow access to TCP/5986, which is the default for remoting over SSL/TLS.
#    Enable PowerShell remoting by executing "enable-psremoting -force".
#
#.Parameter AttemptAutoConfigure
#    Will attempt to select and use a compatible SSL/TLS certificate hands-free
#    without any prompting.  When there are multiple suitable certificates,
#    the one with the longest TTL will be preferred.
#
#.Parameter ClearCurrentSettings
#    Will delete any existing HTTPS settings used for PowerShell remoting.
#    Will not delete any certificates or private keys, just WSMAN settings.
#    May be used by itself or with the -AttemptAutoConfigure switch.
#
#Requires -Version 2.0
