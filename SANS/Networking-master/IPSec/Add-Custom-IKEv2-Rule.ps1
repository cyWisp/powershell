.DESCRIPTION

This script demonstrates how to construct more complex IPsec policies from
within PowerShell.  There are more possible IPsec settings that may be 
specified using PowerShell than can be created (or even seen) in the 
graphical Windows Firewall snap-in tool or in a Group Policy Object.

This script only shows rules which use IKEv2 for key management.
See the Add-Custom-IKEv1-Rule.ps1 script for examples of IKEv1 and AuthIP.

A "proposal" is a combination of particular IPsec settings for a particular
phase of the IPsec negotiation process, such as the cipher, key size, and 
hashing algo used during Phase 1 (P1) Main Mode (MM) negotiations.

A "set" is a collection of one or more "proposals."  There are different types
of sets for different types of proposals for the two phases of the IPsec
negotiation process.

A "library" is a just a list of sets of proposals defined in this script, so
that we may choose a set from our own custom library when creating rules.
The concept of a "library" has no meaning to Windows or Microsoft IPsec, but
you will likely create your own such library to maintain consistency, enforce 
version control, and simplify IPsec management.  

    Library of Authentication Sets:
        AuthSet1:
            AuthProposal1
            AuthProposal2
            AuthProposal3
        AuthSet2:
            AuthProposal1
            AuthProposal2

    Library of Main Mode Crypto Sets:
        MMSet1:
            MMProposal1
            MMProposal2
        MMSet2:
            MMProposal1
        MMSet3:
            MMProposal1
            MMProposal2
            MMProposal3

    Library of Quick Mode Crypto Sets:
        QMSet1:
            QMProposal1
        QMSet2:
            QMProposal1
            QMProposal2

Now, in IKEv2 there are no "Phases", and there is no "Main Mode" or "Quick Mode",
but understandably Microsoft wants to use a single set of PoSh cmdlets to manage
all IPsec rules, and there are at least rough analogies between the negotiation
phases of IKEv1 and the exchanges of IKEv2.  With that said, here are some terms:

"P1" stands for Phase 1, which is the first phase of IPsec negotiations.

"MM" stands for Main Mode, which is the mode of Phase 1 negotiations in IKEv1.

(Note: Windows does not use Aggressive Mode in P1 or otherwise.)

"P2" stands for Phase 2, which is the second phase of IPsec negotiations.

"QM" stands for Quick Mode, which the mode of Phase 2 negotiations in IKEv1.

During IKEv1 negotiations, Phase 1 (in Main Mode) comes first, then Phase 2
(in Quick Mode) comes second.  There are corresponding MM rules and QM rules
in Windows which are created with PowerShell or the Windows Firewall (WF)
graphical snap-in.  In IKEv2, Phase 1 mostly corresponds to the IKE_SA_INIT
exchange and the first part of the IKE_AUTH exchange, then Phase 2 is
kind of like the last part of the IKE_AUTH exchange when the first Child SA
is created.  In any case, proposals created with the following cmdlets are
used for all IKEv1, AuthIP and IKEv2 negotiations, even if the terminology 
of the tools doesn't always match the RFCs.  

Importantly, MM rules created in PowerShell will NOT be visible in the 
Windows Firewall snap-in!  They can only be seen and managed in PowerShell.

Each MM or QM rule is a combination of various proposal sets, such as:

    MMRule1 = AuthSet2 + MMSet3
    MMRule2 = AuthSet1 + MMSet1

    QMRule1 = QMSet2
    QMRule2 = AuthSet1 + QMSet2

When a MM or QM rule does not specify a particular set for some part of
the negotiation process, then the machine-wide defaults are used instead.
Some defaults are hard-coded into the OS (you'll have to RTFM), others
can be managed using the Window Firewall snap-in (IPSec Settings tab),
and most can be managed in PowerShell.  

P2 QM negotiations might negotiate either Transport Mode or Tunnel Mode.
In Windows, Transport Mode is the default.  Tunnel Mode must be explicitly 
enabled in a QM rule.  

Certain types of IPsec objects can be defined as the default for the entire
machine.  These are used when a rule does not specify every option.  In
general, it is best to define what is the default in every case for the
sake of troubleshooting, even if you do not intend to rely on any defaults.

Some cmdlets and IPsec objects in PowerShell are irrelevant to IKEv2, such
as the New-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet cmdlet and P2 authentication in general,
which is a feature of AuthIP.  What about extensible EAP authentication for
IKEv2?  No examples of that in this script.  This script does not assume
you are using RRAS, NPS (RADIUS), DirectAccess, EAP, PEAP, or anything
other than IKEv2's built-in PSK or certificate authentication.

MISC NOTES:

* When creating an IKEv2 rule, you might not get an error in PoSh, the rule might become 
visible in the WF snap-in, but the Security log can show an error that the 
rule was not applied (Category: MPSSVC Rule-Level Policy Change, ID: 4958).
Or, there might be no error in the Security log at and the rule will simply
not be applied at all, e.g., if Kerberos is specified for the IKEv2 rule.  

* When you run this command, $ThisCaString is case-sensitive:

    New-NetIPsecAuthProposal -Machine -Cert -Authority $ThisCaString

The connection will fail if $ThisCaString does not exactly match the Subject field
in the CA's own cert.  However, these two CA Subject strings are treated as
identical, they both work:

    "DC=local, DC=testing, CN=Testing-CA"
    "DC=local,DC=testing,CN=Testing-CA"

* When creating an AuthProposalSet, it must either be just PSK or just cert.  It 
cannot be both cert and PSK.  It cannot be Kerberos, NTLM or any other auth method.
Using anything other than just PSK or just cert will not show any errors in PoSh
or in the Security event log, does not block the selected traffic, does not 
trigger any IKE negotiations, it just does nothing (other than creating a visible
ConSecRule in the WF snap-in, a rule which does nothing).


* Do not use the -Phase2AuthSet parameter.  This will not show any errors in PoSh
or in the Security event log, does not block the selected traffic, does not 
trigger any IKE negotiations, it just does nothing (other than creating a visible
ConSecRule in the WF snap-in, a rule which does nothing).  There is no need then
to run New-NetIPsecPhase2AuthSet or "New-NetIPsecAuthProposal -User".

* In a script to manage IKEv2 rules, purge everything first, only create one
MainModeCryptoSet and use the -Default switch when you do so.  

* Whenever you create a new IPsec item, it creates an additional item 
even if an item with the same DisplayName already exists.  Said another way, you 
can have multiple IPsec items with the same DisplayName, but not the same Name.
Hence, IPsec config scripts usually should first purge all existing IPsec objects
before creating new ones, then use the -Name parameter to help duplicates. If
you try to create a duplicate IPsec object with the same name as an existing
object, you will get a "Catastrophic failure" error.  

* Just because intellisense shows an argument for a parameter does not mean
that that argument is always legal or will resulting in a functioning policy.

* Windows IKEv2 does not support IKEv2 fragmentation. Large UDP packets 
containing certificates will often be fragmented at the IP layer, then dropped 
by routers or firewalls configured to drop IP fragments. 

* For Azure IKEv2 connections at least, Microsoft recommends a TCP MSS of 1350.
